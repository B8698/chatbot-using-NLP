## Overview  
This project showcases an intelligent chatbot built to understand and respond to user input through Natural Language Processing (NLP). By recognizing user intents, the chatbot delivers precise and context-aware replies based on predefined patterns and responses. It incorporates advanced tools like `nltk` for NLP, `scikit-learn` for machine learning, and `streamlit` to offer a seamless web interface.

## Key Features  
- Intuitive intent recognition, including greetings, farewells, and thank-you messages.  
- Delivers insightful, contextually relevant responses.  
- Maintains a conversation log for users to revisit past interactions.  
- Developed in Python using cutting-edge libraries for NLP and machine learning.

## Installation Guide  

### Step 1: Clone the Project Repository  
Start by downloading the project files to your local machine:  
```bash  
git clone <repository-url>  
cd <repository-directory>  
```  

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)  
For dependency management, it’s advisable to use a virtual environment:  
```bash  
python -m venv venv  
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`  
```  

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies  
Install all necessary libraries listed in the requirements file:  
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```  

### Step 4: Download Essential NLTK Data  
Run the following commands to fetch required NLP data:  
```python  
import nltk  
nltk.download('punkt')  
```

## Running the Application  
To launch the chatbot, execute the command below in your terminal:  
```bash  
streamlit run app.py  
```  
Once started, interact with the chatbot through the web interface by typing a message and pressing Enter to see the response.

## Customizing Chatbot Intents  
The chatbot's functionality is powered by an `intents.json` file containing tags, patterns, and responses. Modify this file to extend features or update existing intents.  

---

## Conversation History  
Every interaction is logged into a `chat_log.csv` file. Users can conveniently access their chat history through the app's sidebar for easy reference.
